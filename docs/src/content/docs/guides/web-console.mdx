When Runy [daemon](/guides/daemon) is running, it provides a web console that allows you to manage processes and services through a web interface. 

## Accessing the Web Console

To access the web console, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4122. You will be presented with a user-friendly interface that displays all running processes and services.
