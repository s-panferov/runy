Runy runs as a background service called the "daemon". This guide will walk you through how to manage the runy daemon, including starting, stopping, and checking its status.

## What is the Daemon?

Runy follows a client-server architecture where the daemon acts as the server. It manages processes and services, allowing you to run tasks in the background without needing to keep your terminal open.

```d2 sketch pad=10
direction: right
runy (cli) --> runy (daemon) { 
  label: "GRPC"
}
```

Runy uses gRPC protocol to communicate between the CLI and the daemon.

## Should I run the Daemon?

Runy CLI command will automatically start the daemon if it is not running. However, you can also run the daemon manually if you prefer to manage it yourself.

## Starting the Daemon

To start the runy daemon, use the following command:

```bash
runy daemon start
```

This command will start the daemon in the background, allowing it to manage processes and services.

## Stopping the Daemon

To stop the runy daemon, use the following command:

```bash
runy daemon stop
```

This command will gracefully stop the daemon and all managed processes.

## Killing the Daemon

If the daemon is not responding or you need to forcefully stop it, you can use the `kill` command:

```bash
runy daemon stop --kill
```

Be cautious with this command, as it will immediately terminate the daemon without gracefully stopping processes. Some processes may not be cleaned up properly and can remain running.
