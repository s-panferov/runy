# Service Process Management

Runy provides powerful process management capabilities through the `ctx.process()` method, allowing you to define long-running services with automatic restarts, file watching, and lifecycle management.

## Basic Process Definition

Use `ctx.process()` to define a service process within your service's `run` method:

```javascript
await ctx.process({
  alias: "server",
  cmd: "python3",
  args: ["-m", "http.server", "8500"],
});
```

## Process Configuration Options

### Command and Arguments

- **`cmd`**: The executable command to run
- **`args`**: Array of command-line arguments
- **`alias`**: Unique identifier for the process

### Restart Policies

Configure automatic restart behavior when the process exits. Runy supports four different restart strategies:

#### Never Restart

Prevents the process from restarting automatically:

```javascript
restart: {
  kind: "never";
}
```

#### Always Restart

Restarts the process immediately after it exits (no delay):

```javascript
restart: {
  kind: "always";
}
```

#### Fixed Restart

Restarts with a consistent delay between attempts:

```javascript
restart: {
  kind: "fixed",
  delay: 1000,        // Milliseconds to wait before restart
  maxRestarts: 5      // Optional: maximum restart attempts
}
```

#### Exponential Backoff Restart

Increases the delay between restart attempts exponentially:

```javascript
restart: {
  kind: "exponential",
  initialDelay: 1000,   // Starting delay in milliseconds
  maxDelay: 30000,      // Maximum delay cap in milliseconds
  multiplier: 2.0,      // Factor to multiply delay by each attempt
  maxRestarts: 10       // Optional: maximum restart attempts
}
```

**Example exponential backoff sequence:**

- 1st restart: 1 second delay
- 2nd restart: 2 seconds delay
- 3rd restart: 4 seconds delay
- 4th restart: 8 seconds delay
- ...up to maxDelay

### File Watching

Monitor files and restart the process when changes are detected:

```javascript
watch: ["*.txt", "config.json", "src/**/*.py"];
```

## Complete Example

```javascript
s.run(async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.process({
    alias: "web-server",
    cmd: "python3",
    args: ["-m", "http.server", "8500"],
    restart: {
      kind: "exponential",
      initialDelay: 1000,
      maxDelay: 30000,
      multiplier: 2.0,
      maxRestarts: 10,
    },
    watch: ["*.py", "config/**/*.json"],
  });
});
```

This example creates a Python HTTP server that:

- Runs on port 8500
- Uses exponential backoff restart strategy (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... up to 30s delays)
- Attempts up to 10 restarts before giving up
- Restarts when Python files or config JSON files change
- Can be referenced by the alias "web-server"
