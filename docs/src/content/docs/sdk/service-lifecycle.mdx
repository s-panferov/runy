Services in Runy SDK are defined using the `ws.service` method. Inside the service definition we can specify static properties, autorun behavior and define a `run` function that will be executed when the service is started

```typescript
ws.service("test", (s) => {
  // Static properties, like service name, description, etc.
  // This function body is executed on service creation
  s.autorun();

  // This function is executed when the service is started
  s.run(async (ctx) => {
    // Here we can definy any process, like starting a server
    await ctx.process({
      alias: "server",
      cmd: "python3",
      args: ["-m", "http.server", "8500"],
    });
  });
});
```

The body of the `service` function is executed when the service is created, and the `s.run` function is executed when the service is started. The `ctx` parameter provides access to the service context, which allows you to define resources that will be managed by Runy.
