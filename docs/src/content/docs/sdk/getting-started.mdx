## SDK Runtime

Runy SDK works best in combination with [Bun](https://bun.com/) or [Deno](https://deno.com/) Javascript runtimes. It can also run on Node.js, but Bun or Deno are recommended for better performance and features.

This guide will be using Bun, but the concepts apply similarly to Deno.

## Creating a Workspace file

To create a managed Workspace, you need to define a TypeScript file `my-workspace.ts` using the `@runy-dev/core` SDK.

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env -S bun --watch

import { workspace } from "@runy-dev/core";

const ws = workspace(import.meta);

ws.service("test", (s) => {
  s.autorun();
  s.run(async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.process({
      alias: "server",
      cmd: "python3",
      args: ["-m", "http.server", "8500"],
    });
  });
});
```

This part of the code defines a workspace with a service named "test". The service runs a simple HTTP server using Python.

## Running the managed Workspace

Before running the workspace you need to make your TypeScript file executable. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
chmod +x my-workspace.ts
```

To run the workspace, use the following command:

```bash
runy start my-workspace.ts
```

This command will start the workspace defined in `workspace.ts`. Once started, Runy will analyze the workspace, start the defined services, and manage their lifecycle.

## How it works

When you run the `runy start` command, the following happens:

1. Runy creates a new workspace `my-workspace` based on the file name.
2. It starts a new process inside the workspace, which runs the TypeScript file. The TypeScript is an executable (because of the `#!/usr/bin/env -S bun --watch` line) that executes the code using Bun.
3. The `@runy-dev/core` SDK is imported, which provides the `workspace` function to define services and manage their lifecycle.
4. The SDK communicates with the Runy daemon to manage the services defined in the workspace.

```d2 sketch pad=10 layout=elk
direction: right
runy: Runy
bun: Bun/Deno {
  ts: "my-workspace.ts"
  sdk: Runy SDK

  ts -> sdk: Import Runy SDK
}

runy -> bun: Start my-workspace.ts

bun.sdk -> runy: Define services and manage lifecycle (via gRPC)
```
